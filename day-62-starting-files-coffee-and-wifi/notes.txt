    Corrected two errors, the error in which it was appending a new line to the .csv file at the end of the last line
    in the .csv file. Now it correctly adds each additional 'cafe' as its own row, as well as displays it correctly
    in the /cafes page.
    Still need to change the class for the form to allow the coffee, Wifi, and Power rating all allow emojis, that
    seems to be a drop down menu.
    Also need to adjust the Open/close field to show as 11AM, 7:30AM, instead of a 24 hour 3 field time.
